## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of MATLAB simulations covering fundamental concepts in Communication Systems. These projects bridge the gap between theoretical mathematical models and practical signal processing implementation.

## 🛠 Features & Simulations

### 1. Analog Modulation (AM & FM)
- AM Modulation: Implementation of amplitude modulation showing message-carrier integration.
- FM Modulation: Frequency deviation analysis and signal generation.

### 2. Digital Modulation Techniques
- ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying): Basic digital-to-analog signal conversion.
- QPSK & QAM Constellations: Visualization of M-ary modulation in noisy environments using AWGN channels.

### 3. Signal Power & Energy Analysis
- Numerical calculation of Signal Energy (Integral of $|x(t)|^2$).
- Calculation of Average Power for periodic signals.
- Visual representation of energy density and instantaneous power.

### 4. Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Spectral Analysis (FFT): Transitioning signals from Time-Domain to Frequency-Domain using Fast Fourier Transform.
- Noise Reduction: Implementation of Digital Filters (Low-pass/Butterworth) to recover signals from noisy environments.

## 📊 Results Preview
*Each script generates visual plots (Time Domain, Frequency Spectrum, and Constellation Diagrams) to verify the theoretical performance against simulated data.*
